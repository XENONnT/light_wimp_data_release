This data release are structued as follows:

  * `lightwimp_data_release/data` contains the templates and signal spectrum, with the following catagories:
    * Mono-enegetic simulations for each possible light yield and charge yield combination.
    * Background used in the analysis.
      * `ac`: Accndental coincidence background.
      * `cevns`: Solar B-8 CEvNS background.
      * `rg`: Radiogenic neutron background.
      * `er`: Electronic recoil background.
    * Signals used in the analysis:
      * `wimp_si`: Spin-independent WIMP signal.
      * `wimp_si_n_1/2/m1/m2`: Momemtum dependent dark matter.
      * `mirror_dm`: Mirror dark matter
