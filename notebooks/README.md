# Notebooks

Here are two notebooks you can follow to recast our results in typically two ways:
  
  * (Typically for theorists): Input a different signal model and get constraints. 
  * (Typically for experimentalists): Input a different yield model, and apply it to the already considered signal models (eg. a WIMP of SI interaction) to get new constraints.

This can be done by two steps, which are the topics for the two tutorial notebooks:
  - `1. Templates.ipynb`: Generate templates, the probability distribution function that decribes how a certain signal or background looks like in the detector observables.
  - `2. Inference.ipynb`: Feed the templates into the statistical model (which is briefly introduced), and get limits from inference.
